# EG LTI: Embed Gist
An LTI tool that allows you to embed [Github Gists][1] in your [Canvas][2] pages and discussions.

##How to Use
 1. Add EG to your course or account as an external tool. Paste the configuration URL into the external tool "By URL" field.

        http://[installation URL]/config.xml

 2. This will add the Embed Gist  button the text editor menu bar.
 3. Search for Gists by GitHub username.


##Know Issues
 - There are some problems with text wrapping that will cause the line numbers to display incorrectly. I suggest trying to make sure your code doesn't need to wrap. Also, enlarge the embedded content right after in is inserted.
 - Report bugs or feature requests on [GitHub][3].
